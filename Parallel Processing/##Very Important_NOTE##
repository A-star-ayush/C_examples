Almost all the examples codes in this directory make mistake while passing an int as an argument to a 
on_thread_start functoin.

The syntax of the function is:
	
	int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg)

so if you want to pass an integer as "arg" use the following methodology:
	
	#include <stdint.h>
	
	void *threadfunc(void *param){
    	int id = (intptr_t) param;
    	...
	}

	int i, r;
	r = pthread_create(&thread, NULL, threadfunc, (void *) (intptr_t) i);

The same is included in "test2.c". Remember to include <stdint.h>.
Also a uintptr_t variant also exists.
