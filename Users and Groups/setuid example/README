Compile: gcc code.c  .. if you compile with sudo, you can skip the next step
Change ownership: sudo chown root a.out   .. can use root.root to change the group to root as well
Set setuid bit: sudo chmod +s a.out

The code might not work as desired on filesystems mounted with nosuid attribute... try copying the code to
a different filesystem (or a different partition with may be the same filesystem)..


*** As of Linux 2.2, the power of the superuser (root) has been partitioned into a set of discrete capabilities.
	If the kernel is compiled with compabitily support, try using them (capset) instead of setuid  ***
